Project idea and how it helps NASA/space: 

This project is a simple NASA Mission Countdown webpage. Users enter the mission name and launch date, and the app shows how many days remain until launch. It helps NASA/space enthusiasts and students track upcoming missions, building excitement and awareness.

Technologies/tools used: 

HTML for webpage structure

CSS for styling and layout

JavaScript for countdown logic, validation, and persistence

Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration

How to run or use the project: 

1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub.

2. Open index.html in any web browser.

3. Enter a mission name and select a future launch date.

4. The page shows the days left until launch (saves data locally until cleared).
