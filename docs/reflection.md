Daniah's reflection 

It was my first time using GitHub, and the experience was great. I realized it is more than just a code repository, it can also serve for project planning and team management. Organizing and distributing our work became an easier task using the repositories, branches, issues, pull requests, and the Scrum board. It took me some time to get acquainted with working with branches and writing clear commit messages, but I believe that it will be more enjoyable as I will keep working with GitHub in the following labs.

Wasan's Reflection

This was my first time using GitHub so I learned a lot about it. Prior to this lab, I had no GitHub experience at all. One thing that I learned and was very important is how to create a project and issues. I had heard of the term Kanban board before but it became clearer to me now that I was able to explore GitHub and gain hands-on experience. What I found fun was brainstorming what idea we should decide on with my teammates. What I found challenging was the coding bit because prior to this my only experience with coding was Java. If I had more time, I would focus on improving the overall quality of the code to make it cleaner, more efficient, and easier to maintain. This is because the actual content wasn't part of the grading rubric, so my attention was dedicated towards other aspects of the assignment. 

Maryam's Reflection

To be completely honest, I'm still not used to github, as my first time i found everything strange and confusing to work with. I explored features like branches, issues, and pull requests, and realized how important clear commit messages are for collaboration. I also enjoyed brainstorming ideas with my teammates and seeing how version control keeps the project organized. Overall, the experience gave me more confidence, I'm excited for future labs to get to work more on this platform and work on other projects maybe.
