our reflection is here 
Daniah's reflection 
I learned from this lab that GitHub is not only a place to keep your code but also a species of project planning and organizing! Remember I was also exposed to version control and project management as I studied how repositories, branches, issues were used with pull requests. “Remembering to make good commits with useful commit messages and creating / managing branches properly was one of the toughest things, but it was really cool seeing a new feature take shape bit by bit as we worked on things.”
